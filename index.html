              Autism spectrum disorder is a condition related to the brain development that impacts how a person perceives and socialises with others, causing problems in social interactions and communication. The disorder also includes limited and repetitive patterns of behaviour.
            </p>
            <p>
              Autism is not so bad then you think people with autism have a great memory and an amazing ability to recall facts. Autistic people also tend to be visual thinkers. As a result, they can visualise solutions to problems, as well as other things, better than most people can.
            </p>
            <p>
              No matter what traits of autism you or your loved one may have, a person with autism has their own unique strengths and abilities. There are many famous people with autism spectrum disorder who have used their strengths and abilities to achieve success, fame, or to accomplish amazing things.
            </p>
            <p>
              Restricted interests is a characteristic of autism. This kind of behaviour is restricted. Restricted interests refer to a person with ASD's great devotion for a certain subject. Persons with autism may have a small and narrow range of interests, but people without autism frequently have a wide range of interests, may focus easily from one topic or activity to another, and may not commit to excelling at one particular area.The success that many persons with ASD have in life may be attributed to this trait. The person with ASD can use this interest to achieve great things if they are able to focus and keep up a single core interest for years or even most of their lives.

            <p>
              Oppressive Compulsive Disorder is the involvement of unwanted thoughts that are disturbing and turn into obsessions in a person's mind (usually a child or a teen). These thoughts cause great discomfort and anxiety. The person will then try to reduce the discomfort and anxiety by engaging in repetitive physical or mental behavior known as compulsions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The cause of OCD is not exactly known by scientists. Genetics, brain abnormalities, and the environment itself can play a role in causing or increasing OCD in a person. It often does start in the teens era or in early adulthood but might happen in childhood. OCD affects both men and women. It does appear to run in families thus strengthening the genetics theory. Other mental illnesses, eating disorders, and substance abuse also impact OCD and increase its power.
            </p>
            <p>
              The symptoms of OCD are obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are undiscovered thoughts, worries, and fears. They happen a lot for people with OCD and cause great anxiety. Reasoning doesn’t help to control those obsessions. Some types of obsessions are:

              Repeated doubts
              A needed thing to do something in a very specific order
              Thoughts about violence and hurting others
              Fear of contamination or dirt
            </p>
            <p>
              These obsessions are then expressed for people with OCD. Obsessions like these are controlled with compulsions which is repetitive behavior. Compulsions are actually made up by a person who has OCD. Examples of compulsions included:

              Washing and cleaning
              Checking multiple times
              Counting
              Demanding reassurance
            </p>
            <p>
              These compulsions are also seen quite vividly depending on the person with OCD.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the general definition of OCD and its breakdown. If you are experiencing any of the examples that I listed or just feel anxiety. Please call your doctor just in case. </p>

              Depression is a common illness as 5% of the total adult population suffer from depression. The effects of depression are to suffer greatly and function poorly at work, school, and even at your own house with your family. At the worst stage of depression, the person could suicide. Treatment for this illness is possible but a lot of middle and low class people could receive no treatment at all. Depression itself is when a person experiences a mood of extreme negativity (sadness, irritability, emptiness, anger, loneliness). It could also be a loss of happiness in activities that would make anyone else without depression happy.

              Symptoms of this illness would be:

              Poor concentration to work or school
              Feeling guilt or losing your self-worth
              Looks to towards the future and thinks that it will be bad
              Thoughts about dying
              Insomnia
              Losing appetite or gaining it suddenly
              Low energy and fatigue
            </p>
            <p>
              Depression is an illness indeed. However, the symptoms won’t last forever. In a depressed person’s life, they will get depression episodes which are at least 2 weeks long. Depression episodes are a part of a depressed individual's life and that is when most of the symptoms happen, not all the time like you would expect.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some individuals could only get one depression episode while others could get multiple. You can guess that something bad happened to start up this depression episode like a bad day at school or at work and something terrible happened. This is mostly correct.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the general definition of depression and its breakdown. If you are experiencing any symptoms that I listed or just feel anxiety. Please call your doctor just in case.

            <p>
              There are many different types of unwanted and dangerous stigmas about mental illness. These stigmas range from people thinking about a person's emotions to downright saying that someone is stupid because of a mental illness. These are a few that we need to talk about.
            </p>
            <p>
              Autism is expressed by people as a defect to a person and that defect to society makes them stupid and have no common sense. In other words, autism is an insult to society. This is one of the most hurtful statements that people could say because it disrespects people with autism so much as well as spreading hate to others.
            </p>
            <p>
              Depression is another mental illness that is viewed by the community as extreme sadness and the word itself is used daily to over-exaggerate: "I'm so depressed that didn't kill the final boss in injustice 2". This is quite unfair to people with depression as the challenges they face are much harder than we think in society.
            </p>
            <p>
              OCD is also viewed by the public in a prejudiced way. Without a doubt, people don't understand that compulsions come from obsessions. This means that society thinks OCD is just some psychopathic actions like counting and checking stuff multiple times.
            </p>
            <p>
              ADHD:People still don’t believe that ADHD is a medical condition. They see it as an excuse for sloppiness or laziness. The fact that ADHD symptoms appear to come and go, depending on the situation, only feeds the doubters’ contempt. They say, or think, things like, “Why can’t you pull it together? You’re fine with certain friends — how come you can’t sit down and do your homework?”Another factor is the widespread negative feeling about the use of psychiatric drugs. In recent years, there’s been a surge in the number of people taking ADHD medication. Some wonder if this increase is justified. Finally, the fact that ADHD can undermine academic performance worsens the stigma. Our society seems to think, “If your grades are poor, you’re not worth much.” This is especially true if the cause of poor performance is hidden, as it is with ADHD.

          <p>Steps to cope with stigma
            Here are some ways you can deal with stigma:

          </p>
          <p>
            Get treatment. You may be reluctant to admit you need treatment. Don't let the fear of being labeled with a mental illness prevent you from seeking help. Treatment can provide relief by identifying what's wrong and reducing symptoms that interfere with your work and personal life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't let stigma create self-doubt and shame. Stigma doesn't just come from others. You may mistakenly believe that your condition is a sign of personal weakness or that you should be able to control it without help. Seeking counseling, educating yourself about your condition and connecting with others who have mental illness can help you gain self-esteem and overcome destructive self-judgment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't isolate yourself. If you have a mental illness, you may be reluctant to tell anyone about it. Your family, friends, clergy or members of your community can offer you support if they know about your mental illness. Reach out to people you trust for the compassion, support and understanding you need.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't equate yourself with your illness. You are not an illness. So instead of saying "I'm bipolar," say "I have bipolar disorder." Instead of calling yourself "a schizophrenic," say "I have schizophrenia."
          </p>
          <p>
            Join a support group. Some local and national groups, such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), offer local programs and internet resources that help reduce stigma by educating people who have mental illness, their families and the general public. Some state and federal agencies and programs, such as those that focus on vocational rehabilitation and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), offer support for people with mental illness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Get help at school. If you or your child has a mental illness that affects learning, find out what plans and programs might help. Discrimination against students because of a mental illness is against the law, and educators at primary, secondary and college levels are required to accommodate students as best they can. Talk to teachers, professors or administrators about the best approach and resources. If a teacher doesn't know about a student's disability, it can lead to discrimination, barriers to learning and poor grades.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speak out against stigma. Consider expressing your opinions at events, in letters to the editor or on the internet. It can help instill courage in others facing similar challenges and educate the public about mental illness.
